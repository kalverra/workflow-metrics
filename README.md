# Workflow Metrics

## Dream

* Analyze GitHub Actions Runner stats using [gopsutil](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil) (similar to https://github.com/catchpoint/workflow-telemetry-action/tree/master)
* Also track runtimes and costs of each workflow/job/step
* Be able to construct "Here is what your PRs / Merge Queues look like"
* Can also send this data to Splunk/DX for tracking there
* Provide HTML interface to easily see and understand this data
* Store data on GitHub as artifacts and enable easy comparison
